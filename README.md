# Outlier Detection Using a GPU-based Parallel Algorithm: Quantum Clustering

We propose a new assumption in outlier detection: normal data instances are commonly located in the area that there is hardly any fluctuation on data density, while outliers are often appeared in the area that there is violent fluctuation on data density. And based on this hypothesis, we apply a novel density-based approach to unsupervised outlier detection. This approach, called Quantum Clustering (QC), deals with unlabeled data processing and constructs a potential function to find the centroids of clusters and the outliers. The experiments show that the potential function could clearly find the hidden outliers in data points effectively. Besides, by using QC, we could find more subtle outliers by adjusting the parameter Ïƒ. Moreover, our approach is also evaluated on several benchmarks from different research areas, and the results show the wide applicability of our method.
